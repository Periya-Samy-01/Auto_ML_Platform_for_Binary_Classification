# 🧠 AutoML Web App – Binary Classification System

This is a complete AutoML system for binary classification problems. It allows users to:

- Upload a CSV dataset
- Select ML models to train
- Automatically apply hyperparameter tuning
- View training results and evaluation metrics
- Download the trained models

Built using:
- 🧪 FastAPI (backend for training and model serving)
- 📊 Streamlit (frontend UI)
- 🤖 Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Upload your own dataset (CSV format)  
✅ Choose from 5 top classification algorithms  
✅ View metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC-ROC  
✅ Download trained models (`.pkl`)  
✅ FastAPI + Streamlit integration  
✅ Supports only **binary classification**

---

## 📦 Algorithms Used

- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- LightGBM  
- CatBoost  
- HistGradientBoosting

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/automl-classifier.git
cd automl-classifier
````

2. **Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧪 Run the App

### Start the FastAPI backend:

```bash
uvicorn backend:app --reload
```

### Run the Streamlit frontend:

```bash
streamlit run frontend.py
```

> The Streamlit UI will open at `http://localhost:8501`
> FastAPI backend runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## 🐳 Docker Deployment (Optional)

Coming soon: You can containerize the app using Docker and deploy it for free using platforms like Railway or Render.

---

## 📌 Notes

* Only works for **binary classification** datasets.
* The target column (label) must be the **last column** in the dataset.
* Supports numerical features only. Convert any categorical features before uploading.
